                    Hi My name is Nancy Mburu! 
                    <br></br>
                    I hold a bachelors degree in Communication, Writing and Public policy from the university of washington. 
                    I'm a passionate learner at the intersection of technology and creativity. 
                    With a keen interest in coding, I'm driven by its transformative potential and continually strive to master it. 
                    Alongside coding, I have a deep love for writing, nurtured through various fellowships and internships. 
                    My goal is to merge these passions, creating innovative solutions and captivating narratives that leave a lasting impact.
                </p>

            <p> This project showcases my skill in html and css. 
                The goal was to create a simple web page that shows Boston's top 5% earners. 
                A README page is included to further explain the goal of the project.
